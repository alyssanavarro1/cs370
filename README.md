I developed the code that demonstrates the reinforcement learning algorithm. I wrote the game loops that utilize Keras and Tensorflow to achieve the pathfinding solution. The code given to me includes GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py.

Computer scientists solve complex problems with technology in innovative ways. This is important because without them we wouldn't have the advances in technology we have now. For me I like to approach problems with a technical mindset. I use resources at my disposal and current technology knowledge to solve problems efficiently.

One of the most important ethical concerns I learned about in this course regards hidden bias in AI. Any AI system can have biases implemented into it and can harm our society without anyone being aware.
